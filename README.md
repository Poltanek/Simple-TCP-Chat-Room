# Simple-TCP-Chat-Room
A **TCP Chat System** created through **Python** where I began to learn sockets and threading and eventually I plan to create a voice chat and screen sharing as well to join a chat they will need to type in the correct port details to join.   

## Installation & Running Requirements
- Clone Repository
- Python 3.11.9
- Install Tkinter Library
- Visual Studio Code

### To Run
- Run the **Server** from the CLI
- Run the **1st Client Side** of the Program from the VSCode Editor
- Run the next **2nd Client Side** from the CLI

What should effectively happen is two clients will join to the same local hosted server on your computer which where both clients can simultanously chat together on.
